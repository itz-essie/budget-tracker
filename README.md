## Description
 Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success. This is a budget tracker for those who will like to get a handle on  their finances! The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they will be able to populate the total when brought back online.
